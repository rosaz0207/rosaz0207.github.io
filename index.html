      <blockquote>The Icelandic language has remained unchanged since the Viking Age. It is not nerssacarly hard to learn Icelandic words but it is difficult it sounds and how the vocabulary is very different. Icelandic also have some long vocabulary words. Icelandic words can be pronounced wrong and even challenging for visitors to say. Icelandic is still challenging to learn due to its complex grammar and pronouciation. The lagnuage though, it is similar to German. They even have a day to celebrate their language. It was celebrated because of Jonas Hallgrimmson 19th birthday as Icelandic Language Day!  </blockquote>

        <p> The only animal found in Iceland is an Artic Fox. Fun factor, Iceland's naional animal is The Gyrfalcon. One of the most fun and interesting fact about Iceland is that it revolves around elves, trolls and other mystical creatures. Many Icelanders are still convinced that they actually exist because of all the obvious figures around Iceland. Iceland had its very own monsters and mythical creatures. Ghost, Trolls, Nykur (horse water) and Lagarfljot worm--which is considered the country's "very own lochness monster" Gyrfalcon is fearcely protected throughout the country. </p>

  Iceland was the last place on earth to be settled by humans. I guess they wanted to save the best for last if you asked me. But it was accidently discovered by the vikings back like 1,000 years ago from Norway. It was found in June 17, 1944. The country of Iceland is surrounded by glaciers which is why it is also popular. Since Iceland is basically the country of Fire and Ice. Volcanoes and glaciers will be seen which makes it unique and awesome. The Northern Lights is also a popular view that many wants to see. It can be seen from September to March so many travelers are atrracted to it. Iceland nationals colours are red, white, and blue. For it was said that red, white for the snow and ice and blue for the ocean.
